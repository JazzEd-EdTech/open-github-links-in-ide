## Supported IDEs:

* VSCode
* VSCode Insiders
* PhpStorm
* WebStorm (not tested yet)

PhpStorm support is native on MacOS, but on Linux and Windows you need to install an url handler:

* Linux: https://github.com/sanduhrs/phpstorm-url-handler
* Windows: https://github.com/aik099/PhpStormProtocol

I have not tested WebStorm support yet, feedbacks are welcome!
